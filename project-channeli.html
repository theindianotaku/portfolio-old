                <h2>Re-Design of <strong>Channel i</strong></h2>
                <p class="label">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
                <p class="lead">Channel i is the intranet e-portal of IIT Roorkee which provides various services for the students, faculty and alumni of the institute. This is the base/parent application for which various services are made for. The nucleus (all the base assets) have been developed by various people over the years, since it’s launch in 2002. The current Channel i features are as follows</p>
				<p class="lead">
					<ul>
						<li>A feed recording all the activity of the students like posting a lost/found item, uploading lectures and tutorials, posting an item for sale and any event coming up next.</li>
						<li>A dashboard for listing all the applications currently active.</li>
						<li>An events and calendar application listing down the upcoming events, create/edit events, and an academic calendar.</li>
						<li>Notices (Web Application, discussed in this project) Application for listing out the notices uploaded by various authorities of the institute. This is the most used and most important application of Channel i.</li>
						<li>A section of quick links to some of the important miscellaneous utilities.</li>
						<li>Helpdesk, which is the internal FAQ platform dedicated for the applications of Channel i.</li>
						<li>Has multiple theme options to customise the look.</li>
						<li>A notification dashboard to handle various subscriptions and to handle the queries asked by the various students and faculties through the feedback service.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="lead">Being such a heavy and diverse app, one can expect the code base to have the same weight too. Yes, the application uses Vanilla JS for handling the structuring. URL listing and routing, script and stylesheets loading, fetching views and handling the hash changes are all handled using plain Javascript.The templating is handled by Django templating and Handlebars JS. This is quite an well-structured app considering the fact that it doesn’t use any frameworks to handle being a single-page application.</p>
