				<p class="lead"><strong>IITR Fresherlogue</strong> is a platform for the freshers to know more about IIT Roorkee by interacting with the currently enrolled students and read articles written by various students and Campus groups of IIT Roorkee.</p>
				<p>The main aim of this platform was to bring the existing students of IIT Roorkee close to the freshers so that the freshers can get a proper insight on the Institute. The environment of this place is quite different from what they have yet experienced. This is true, both for the freshers and their parents. This platform would help the students clarify any doubts that they have regarding various aspects of the Institute by creating a link between them and the existing students.</p>
				<p>The main features planned for this app were showcasing articles, senior connect, peer connect and content moderation. Due to the lack of time, we couldn’t implement the Peer Connect feature.</p>
				<p>My first step as a full-stack designer started in March 2016 with the UX/UI designing process. I chose Material Design Guidelines to be the base for my design process MD had a very straight-forward to understand and implement and had a very clean UI. Adapting my thoughts to Material Design for Web took some time. I spent almost a week deciding the type of layout to use for this project. Next came the task of determining the workflow of the app as there were 4 user types who were going to use this app. They are Freshers, Existing Students, Campus Groups and Content Moderators. After going through 3 rounds of iterations and improvements, the wireframes and mockups were finally completed. With this the next step of coding the application started.</p>
				<p>The logo of this application emerged from the idea of ‘people coming together’ and the amber color scheme brought in a feeling of freshness. The cards were material design based. The floating action button served the purpose of directing the user to do specific task or the signified the main task in the current view.</p>
				<p>This app featured a complete blogging platform. This included writing/editing/deleting articles with dedicated views. CKEditor was used for article writing. The images  included in the answers had the Flexbox plugin attached and this was done dynamically by providing the CKEditor with a custom config (which was developed for a previous project). This app used AJAX based content loading and lack of any templating engine was a drawback in this project. This issue will solved in the next iteration of this application. The application had a ‘copy link to clipboard’ feature which was implemented using Vanilla JS with the help of an answer on StackOverflow.</p>
				<p>This project included both a web app and an android app. The android app was mostly designed and developed by my fellow team member, I was in-charge of suggesting  small UI tweaks to the existing design and providing various other design assets like icons, logo, onboarding screens, splash screen and feature posters for the social marketing within our Institute.</p>
				<p>Currently the web application is offline so I have attached various assets of the project below. </p>
